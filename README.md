# Learning Node.js

Welcome to my Node.js learning repository! This README will serve as a central hub to track my progress, list key concepts learned, and provide links to resources and projects.

## Goals

* Gain a solid understanding of Node.js fundamentals.
* Learn how to build server-side applications with Node.js.
* Explore popular Node.js frameworks and libraries (e.g., Express.js).
* Understand asynchronous programming concepts.
* Learn how to interact with databases using Node.js.
* Practice building small projects to solidify my understanding.

## Topics Covered

As I learn, I'll update this section with the key concepts I've covered.

* **2025-05-10**: Setting up the Node.js Environment - Installing Node.js and npm, understanding the basic command-line interface. [Link to my initial setup notes](setup_notes.md)
* **2025-05-12**: Introduction to JavaScript for Node.js - Revisiting core JavaScript concepts relevant to server-side development (scope, closures, prototypes). [Link to JS review exercises](js_review/)
* **2025-05-15**: Modules in Node.js - Exploring CommonJS modules, using `require` and `module.exports`. Creating and using my own modules. [Link to module examples](module_examples/)
* **2025-05-18**: npm and Package Management - Installing, updating, and uninstalling packages. Understanding `package.json` and `node_modules`.
* **2025-05-21**: Asynchronous Programming with Callbacks - Understanding the event loop, non-blocking I/O, and working with callback functions. [Notes on callback patterns](callbacks.md)
* **2025-05-24**: Introduction to Promises - Understanding the concept of Promises and how they simplify asynchronous operations. Converting callback-based functions to Promises. [Promise examples](promises/)
* **2025-05-27**: Async/Await - Utilizing `async` and `await` keywords for cleaner asynchronous code. [Async/await examples](async_await/)
* **2025-05-30**: Introduction to Express.js - Setting up a basic Express.js server, defining routes, and handling requests and responses. [My first Express app](express_app/)

## Projects

This section will list the small projects I build to practice my Node.js skills.

* **File System Explorer (Started: 2025-05-16)**: A command-line tool to navigate and list files and directories. [https://github.com/your_username/file-explorer](https://github.com/your_username/file-explorer)
* **Simple Web Server (Completed: 2025-05-22)**: A basic HTTP server that can serve static HTML files. [https://github.com/your_username/simple-web-server](https://github.com/your_username/simple-web-server)
* **Task Manager API (Started: 2025-05-28)**: A RESTful API built with Express.js for managing a list of tasks (create, read, update, delete). [https://github.com/your_username/task-manager-api](https://github.com/your_username/task-manager-api)

## Challenges and Learnings

This section will be used to note down any challenges I encounter and key learnings I take away from the process.

* **2025-05-19**: Understanding `this` keyword in different contexts within Node.js modules - Learned about the importance of binding and arrow functions.
* **2025-05-25**: Debugging asynchronous code - Discovered the usefulness of `console.log` statements and using the Node.js debugger.
* **2025-05-31**: Properly handling errors in Express.js middleware - Understood the need for centralized error handling.

## Next Steps

This section will outline my immediate plans for continuing my Node.js learning journey.

* Dive deeper into Express.js middleware and routing.
* Explore different database options (MongoDB with Mongoose).
* Learn about authentication and authorization in Node.js applications.
* Start building a more complex full-stack application with a front-end framework.
